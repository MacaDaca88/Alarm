Sensors used:
Pir motion sensor x1
1x 16keypad
1x 3x4 matrix keypad
1x 8 led module addresseabe
1x 31 led strip addressable leds
1x fingerprint reader 
1x relay switch module
1x microphone sensor
1x playback recording sensor

My idea is to have a automated house, using light sensors to adjust led light strips.
Pir motion sensors to trigger leds and sirens to alert intruder.
You are able to sign in via fingerprint sensor or 1 of 2 keypads.
I am using a mega with wifi so will be able to recive alerts via cellphone
